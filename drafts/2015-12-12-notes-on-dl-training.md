# Convolution VS. Correlation

It comes from one basic fact that although we call CNN *Convolutional* Nerual Network, 
actually it is *Correlational* Nerual Network for most famous deep learning frameworks implement *Convolution* as *Correlation*.
(except Theano, which does use Convolution to implement convolution layer). 

Bengio in his book *Deep Learning* has pointed out this:

many neural network libraries implement arelated function called the cross-correlation, 
which is the same as convolution butwithout ï¬‚ipping the kernel:

# About activation function

Batch Normalization and PReLU cannot work appropriately. (why?)
