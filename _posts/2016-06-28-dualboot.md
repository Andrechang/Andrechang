after install then continue testing ubuntu
and place ubuntu boot as first using efibootmgr. Don't put windows boot as first.

then reboot to windows and then shutdown using windows.

Remove usb-boot. And then turn on and boot on ubuntu.

Then on the right-top corner go to System Information->System&Updates->Additional Drivers
And select the Nvidia driver not the Xorg stuff (Make sure it is connect to internet).

Then reboot. If it get stuff then press powerbutton to restart.

Don't update the nvidia drivers using command line. it breaks the desktop.

To install CUDA. Download the bin file from: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
Don't install the Nvidia drivers using the bin. Say no to drivers since you already have them.
Just install the CUDA toolkit and the samples.
