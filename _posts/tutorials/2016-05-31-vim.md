This is my Vim cheatsheet. For noobs only.

# Vim indentation
gg=G - reindent the entire file

# Vim search and replace
:%s/foo/bar/g - search for foo and replace it with bar in the file.
:%s/foo/bar/gc - same as above but this will ask for confirmation before replace.
:%s/foo/bar/gci - case sensitive search.

# Vim search
\* - search the next word before index
\# - search previous word before index

# Vim using tabs
Open many files in new tabs
vim -p firtfile secondfile thridfile

:tabnew filename - Create a new file in a new tab

:tabe filepath - Open a file in a new tab

:tabn - switches to the next tab.

:tabp - switches to the previous tab.

gt - toggles through all tabs, from left to right.

gT - similar to gt but in opposite direction.

:tabdo %s/foo/bar/g - run a command on all tabs. Eg.: Run command %s/foo/bar/g on all tabs.
